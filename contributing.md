Thanks for your interest in contributing! This project is actively growing and new tools are welcome. Every contribution — whether a new tool, bug fix, or documentation improvement — is appreciated.

## How to Add a New Tool

### 1. Create a New Tool

Add a new file inside the `tools/` directory:

```
tools/
└── my_tool.py
```

Implement your tool using the standard pattern:

```python
from utils.helpers import is_valid_domain

def your_tool_name(domain: str) -> dict:
    """
    One clear sentence describing what this tool does.
    """
    try:
        if not is_valid_domain(domain):
            return {"success": False, "error": "Invalid domain format"}

        result = {}

        return {
            "success": True,
            "domain": domain,
            # additional fields
        }

    except Exception as e:
        return {"success": False, "error": str(e)}
```

For tools that operate on IP addresses, validate using Python's built-in `ipaddress` module:

```python
import ipaddress

try:
    ip = str(ipaddress.ip_address(ip_address.strip()))
except ValueError:
    return {"success": False, "error": "Invalid IP address format"}
```

---

### 2. Register the Tool

Import and register the tool in `server.py`:

```python
from tools.file_name import tool_name

mcp.tool()(tool_name)
```

---

### 3. Add Tests

Create a corresponding test file inside the `tests/` directory:

```
tests/
└── test_my_tool.py
```

Run the tests:

```bash
pytest tests/test_my_tool.py -v
```

All tests should pass without any warning or error.

Every new tool must include at least:

- One **happy-path** test (valid input, expected output)
- One **failure-path** test (invalid input or error handling)

---

### 4. Verify with MCP Inspector

Test the tool using MCP Inspector:

```bash
fastmcp dev inspector server.py
```

Verify that:

- The tool appears in the available tools list
- Inputs are validated correctly
- Expected results are returned
- Error handling works as intended

---

### 5. Update Documentation & `mcp.json`

- Add the tool to the relevant tools-table in `README.md`
- Add the relevant info in `mcp.json`
- If the tool requires an API key, document how to obtain and configure it in the README & mcp.json

---

### 6. Update `.env.example` , `requirements.txt` and `uv.lock` (If Applicable)

If your tool requires new environment variables, add them to `.env.example` & server.json with placeholder values:

```env
SHODAN_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

> **Never** commit real API keys, secrets, or credentials to the repository.

## Adding a New Tool to Full Recon

Additional steps on top of [How to Add a New Tool](#how-to-add-a-new-tool), do those first.

### 1. Register the Tool

Add an entry to `TOOL_REGISTRY` in `tools/signals/registry.py`:

```python
from tools.your_tool_file import your_tool_name
from tools.signals.your_tool_file import your_tool_extractor

TOOL_REGISTRY = [
    ...
    {
        "name": "your_tool",
        "fn": your_tool_name,
        "wave": 1,
        "args": lambda domain, results: (domain,),
        "extractor": your_tool_extractor,
    },
]
```

- `wave`: waves run in order (1 -> 2 -> 3), tools within a wave run in parallel. Pick by category, not just by whether the tool needs `domain`:
  - **Wave 1**, lightweight API and infrastructure record lookups (`whois`, `dns`, `ssl`, `email_security`, `asn`).
  - **Wave 2**, aggressive port/tech scans and throttled log aggregators (`ports`, `techstack`, `ct_logs`; crt.sh rate-limits).
  - **Wave 3**, tools that depend on Wave 1/2 output (`ip_reputation`, which needs an IP resolved by `asn`/`dns`).
- `should_run` / `skip_reason`: use when the tool can't run without another tool's successful output, e.g. `ip_reputation` needs an IP address, so it only runs if `asn`/`dns` resolved one. If `should_run` returns `False`, `fn` is never called and the tool is recorded as skipped with `skip_reason` instead of a result.

---

### 2. Write the Extractor

Add a file in `tools/signals/`:

```python
def your_tool_extractor(result, signals):
    if not result.get("success"):
        return

    signals["your_signal_key"] = result.get("some_field")
```

Add `your_signal_key` with a default value to the base `signals` dict in `tools/signals/extractor.py`, otherwise `_format_signals_block()` will `KeyError` on skipped/failed runs. Match the default to the signal's type, not just `None`: `None` for a not-yet-known scalar (`domain_expiry_days`), `[]` for a list (`dns_missing_records`, `open_ports`), `{}` for grouped data (`email_security`), `0` for a counter (`subdomain_count`), `False` for a flag (`ip_reputation_flagged`).

---

### 3. Add Auto-Warnings

Append plain-English strings to `signals["auto_warnings"]` when a value crosses a risk threshold. Follow the tiered pattern in `ssl_extractor`:

```python
if expiry < 0:
    signals["auto_warnings"].append(f"SSL certificate expired {abs(expiry)} days ago — all HTTPS traffic at risk")
elif expiry < 14:
    signals["auto_warnings"].append(f"SSL certificate expires in {expiry} days — CRITICAL, renew immediately")
```

---

### 4. Update the Report

- Add a line for your signal in `_format_signals_block()` in `tools/fullrecon_tool.py`; required, or the LLM never sees it.
- Update `tools/prompts/threat_analysis.py` only if the signal needs its own correlation rule (see "EVIDENCE QUALITY RULES").

---

### 5. Update Documentation

- Add the tool to `Included in full_recon` in `README.md`, not `Standalone Tools`.

---

### 6. Add Tests

- Unit test the tool (happy path + failure path).
- Test the extractor directly with mocked `result` dicts, asserting on `signals`.
- Update `mock_signals_full` in `tests/test_full_recon.py` if you added a new signal key.

```bash
pytest tests/ -v
```

## Guidelines

| Rule               | Detail                                                                                                     |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Consistency**    | Every tool returns `{"success": True/False, ...}`                                                          |
| **Validation**     | Always validate inputs before making external calls                                                        |
| **Error handling** | Catch exceptions and return `{"success": False, "error": str(e)}`                                          |
| **Dependencies**   | Check if a library is already used before adding a new one                                                 |
| **Legal**          | Use `scanme.nmap.org` for port scanning tests — the only public host officially permitted for Nmap testing |
| **API keys**       | Never hardcode keys; always use `os.getenv("YOUR_API_KEY")`                                                |
